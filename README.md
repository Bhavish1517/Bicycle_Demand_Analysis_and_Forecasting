# Bicycle Demand Analysis and Forecasting

## Description

This repository presents a comprehensive data science project focused on analyzing and forecasting bicycle demand. Using real-world data, the notebook in this project walks through exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and interpretation to help understand the drivers of bicycle rentals and predict future demand.

---

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build robust models that can accurately forecast bicycle rental demand given various factors such as weather, seasonality, and holidays. This is achieved through systematic data exploration, statistical analysis, and application of advanced machine learning algorithms.

---

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares the raw dataset, handling missing values and outliers.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes trends, seasonality, correlations, and influential factors affecting bicycle demand.
- **Feature Engineering**: Constructs new predictive features (e.g., extracting date parts, weather groupings) to improve model performance.
- **Model Building**: Compares multiple regression models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizes model parameters.
- **Forecast Visualization**: Plots predictions versus actuals to illustrate model accuracy and usability.
- **Model Interpretation**: Analyzes feature importance and provides actionable insights for business decision-making.
